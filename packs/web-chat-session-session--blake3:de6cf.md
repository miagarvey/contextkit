## Goal
The goal of this analysis is to understand customer churn by examining various factors such as churn rate, acquisition channels, lifetime value, order frequency, and recency. By analyzing these factors, businesses can identify drivers of churn and develop strategies to reduce it.

## Canonical Definitions
- Churn Rate: The percentage of customers who have stopped using a product or service during a certain time frame.
- Lifetime Value: The total revenue a customer is expected to generate over the entire relationship with a business.
- Acquisition Channel: The marketing channel through which a customer was acquired.

## Entities & Relationships
- Customers: Identified by unique identifiers in the dataset.
- Status: Indicates whether a customer is active or has churned.
- Acquisition Channel: Shows how customers were acquired.

## Reusable SQL
None identified

## Pinned Results
- Churn Rate: 20%
- Channels with higher churn: Email Marketing and Paid Search
- Potential correlation between lifetime value, order frequency, and churn

## Pitfalls / Constraints
- Limited dataset with only 15 customers may not be representative of the entire customer base.
- Data quality issues such as missing values or inaccuracies could impact the analysis results.

## Next Steps
- Conduct further analysis on average lifetime value and order frequency for active vs. churned customers.
- Explore additional factors such as customer demographics or product usage patterns to gain deeper insights into churn drivers.
