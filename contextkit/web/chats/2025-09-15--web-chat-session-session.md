To effectively address your churn rate, consider the following steps based on the context of your analysis:

1. **Understand Your Current Churn Rate**: You have identified a churn rate of 20%. Use this as a benchmark to evaluate any strategies you implement.

2. **Analyze Acquisition Channels**: Since email marketing and paid search are channels with higher churn, investigate why customers acquired through these channels are more likely to leave. Consider revisiting your messaging or targeting strategies for these channels.

3. **Evaluate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Analyze the lifetime value of both active and churned customers. If churned customers have a lower CLV, focus on increasing the value provided to customers early in their lifecycle to build loyalty.

4. **Monitor Order Frequency and Recency**: Look into whether customers who churn have different order frequencies or recency patterns compared to active customers. This can help you identify behavioral patterns that precede churn.

5. **Address Data Limitations**: Be aware that your current dataset is limited to 15 customers. Consider collecting more data or using a larger sample size to ensure your findings are representative.

6. **Enhance Customer Engagement**: Develop strategies to engage customers, such as personalized communication, loyalty programs, or improved customer support, especially focusing on those at risk of churning.

7. **Explore Additional Factors**: Look into other potential drivers of churn, such as customer demographics or product usage patterns, for more comprehensive insights.

By focusing on these areas, you can develop targeted strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
