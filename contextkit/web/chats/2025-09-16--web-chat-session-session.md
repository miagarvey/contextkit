Orcas, also known as killer whales (Orcinus orca), are fascinating marine mammals and are the largest members of the dolphin family. They are known for their striking black-and-white coloration and high intelligence. Here's an overview of their eating habits:

1. **Diet Diversity**: Orcas are apex predators with a diverse diet that varies depending on their pod's geographic location and cultural hunting practices. They are known to eat fish, squid, and a variety of marine mammals, including seals, sea lions, and even other whales.

2. **Specialized Hunting Techniques**: Different orca populations have developed unique hunting techniques. For instance:
   - **Fish-eating orcas** (often referred to as "resident" orcas) primarily consume fish, with a strong preference for salmon in the Pacific Northwest.
   - **Mammal-eating orcas** (also known as "transient" or "Bigg's" orcas) target marine mammals such as seals and porpoises.
   - In Antarctica, orcas use a technique called "wave-washing" to knock seals off ice floes.

3. **Social Hunting**: Orcas often hunt in pods, working together to catch their prey. This cooperative hunting strategy is one of the reasons they are successful predators.

4. **Cultural Transmission**: There is evidence that orcas pass hunting strategies and dietary preferences culturally from one generation to the next, much like humans do.

5. **Feeding Behavior**: Orcas can adapt their hunting strategies based on the availability of prey, which shows their high level of intelligence and adaptability.

Understanding these eating habits provides insight into the ecological role of orcas in marine environments and highlights the complex social structures within their pods.
